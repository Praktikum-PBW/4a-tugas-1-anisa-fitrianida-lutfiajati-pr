        <dd>
            <p><span id="cat"><strong>C</strong></span>at (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small <b>carnivorous mammal</b> . 
            It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred 
            to as the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
            A cat can either be a <b>house cat</b>, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely 
            and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their 
            ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
            
            <p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, 
            quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. 
            Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations 
            like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. 
            A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a 
            social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those 
            made by mice and other small mammals. Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.</p>
            
            <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often 
            ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered 
            pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying 
            and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers 
            of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.</p>
            
            <p>Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC. It was long thought 
            that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC.
            As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.
            As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned.
            In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.</p>

        <h2 id="charac">Characteristics</h2>
    <h4>Size</h4>
    <p>Diagram of the general anatomy of a male domestic cat
        The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.
        It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, 
        with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.
        Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).</p>
    <br><h4>Skeleton</h4>
    <p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); 
        seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); 
        and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only vestigial caudal vertebrae, 
        fused into an internal coccyx).[60]: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's 
        spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis. 
        16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which 
        allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.</p>
    <br><h4>Skull</h4>
    <p>The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful 
        specialized jaw. 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. 
        When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, 
        inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible 
        paralysis and death. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth 
        relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, 
        which have small vertebrae. The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on 
        each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. 
        These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are 
        largely incapable of mastication. 37  Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, 
        with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, 
        less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless 
        subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.</p>
    <br><h4>Claws</h4>
    <p>Cats have protractible and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are
        sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing 
        wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore 
        feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on 
        one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra 
        traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.
        
        Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to 
        the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special 
        feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking, but is thought 
        to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (“polydactyly”).
        Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and in Great Britain.</p>
    <br><h4>Ambulation</h4>
    <p>The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part 
        of the visible leg. Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side 
        of the body before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close 
        to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides 
        sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up walking to trotting, its gait 
        changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.</p>
    <br><h4>Balance</h4>
    <p>Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for sitting in high places, or perching. A higher place may serve 
        as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch. 
        Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its 
        territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.
        
        During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using 
        its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex. A cat always rights 
        itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) 
        or more. How cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the "falling cat problem".</p>
    <br>
        <h2 id="behav">Cat Behavior</h2>
    <p>
        Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.
        Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes, but can range many hundreds 
        of meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study 
        ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres). The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied, 
        which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater human activity at these times.
    <br>
    <br>
        Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep 
        varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. 
        The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, 
        cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.

        is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, 
        they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.”
